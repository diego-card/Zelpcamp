### Objective

The objective of this project was to learn about concepts and implemantation of Web Development.

### WARNING

Not all routes (potentially other things) are functioning correctly. This project was done a long time ago, therefore, updating dependencies caused some issues.

Despite that, I still think putting this here is valuable, because of the things I learned and also for seeing my progress.
